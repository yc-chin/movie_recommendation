**Movie Recommendation System**

In this project, we looked at creating a movie recommendation system using the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset. The goal of this project was to create an algorithm that minimises the root mean squared error (RMSE), which translates to greater accuracy in predicting a user’s movie preferences. 

Here is a broad overview of the project’s implementation:
1. Import the MovieLens dataset and generate the validation and final holdout sets using the provided code.
2. Conduct exploratory analyses on the validation dataset
3. Generate training and test sets from the validation set
4. Implement a content-based filtering strategy
5. Implement matrix factorisation using the recosystem package
6. Evaluate the model using the final holdout set

The pdf file in this repository provides a step-by-step guide on how the movie recommendation was developed.
